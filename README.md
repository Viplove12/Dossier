# Dossier
## A decentralized credentials  management system

Dossier is a decentralized e-portfolio and credentials management platform built on top of Ethereum Blockchain. Dossier aims effective storage, easy and instant verification of educational credentials. Harnessing the power of Blockchain, Dossier is decentralized, hence reducing maintenance costs and improving security. Dossier aims to be an tamper-proof platform which will aid universities, students as well as various organizations that want to verify educational credentials of a person. 
# Why? 
Conventional systems being used have a lot of unnoticed issues that can be solved using technology. For instance, paper for various certificates and degrees. Problem with paper documents is that not only they're easy to get accidentally damaged or misplaced, but such documents can get tampered as well. There have been many cases where fake documents were made and used. Fake documents are getting harder and harder to distinguish from originals. Also, the credential management and verification is one hectic task for educational institutions. It involves a lot of paperwork which is costly not only financially but also environmentally. Also, paper documents need to be carried by applicants in each interview and this involves risk of documents being misplaced. One solution to this is to maintain credentials online on a server but this solution is flawed in itself. One problem with holding data on such servers is that the server is centralized. Centralized servers have a single point of failure. These can be compromised as well. 
# Solution 
Dossier provides easy storage and instant verification of educational credentials without using paper. Everything is stored on Blockchain in a smart contract. Data stored is immutable and hence is tamper-proof. Dossier gives an easy platform to institutes to manage credentials of students which would save time and cost. It would also save time for recruiters and hiring managers of various organizations by giving them the ability to instantly verify credentials of a person. Also one doesn't have to worry about damaging or misplacing his documents.
